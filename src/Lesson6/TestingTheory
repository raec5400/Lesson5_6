Testing Theory
==============
Goals of Testing:
1) "Complete Code Coverage": It's impossible for every line in your code
to be executed in one run (ex - if statements). The goal is to ensure
that every line gets run at least once. Requires several trials.
2) Efficiency: Testers want to avoid using test data that belongs
to the same "Equivalence Class". This is data that will send you 
down the same path of execution each time you run the program.

Strategies:
1) Test "boundary conditions". This is data that falls
right on or near boundaries. Ex - Number must be 10 to 20, so 
test 9, 10, 11,19, 20, 21
2) Test with "extreme conditions". This is data that is far away 
from acceptable limits. Ex - test 1 million or -1 million

Boundaries:
Type - try 0, 1, 2, 3
Rate - try 6.74, 6.75, 30.50, 30.51
Hours - try -1, 0, 1, 59, 60, 61

Extreme
Type - try -1000, +1000
Rate - try -100, +100
Hours - try -100, +100
